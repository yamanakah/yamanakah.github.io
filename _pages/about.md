## Why this blog?
The continuous technological progress around us demands an increasing connection between education and future employment. While buzzwords like "AI", "machine learning" and so forth might be overused at times, it is undoubtedly true that many processes across industries will be eventually solved by machines instead of humans.

What does this mean for us? To stay ahead of the curve, one has to understand the technology that may replace current practices. A solid foundation in programming is one of the keys to a successful career in any field these days. And because the technological possibilities are improving fast, the coding we learn in school might not be relevant anymore in a few years.

Being a life-long learner, while essential for staying future-proof, can be fun, challenging and a great character strength to show to any employer. As [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/02/06/discover-the-global-trends-impacting-your-career) puts it, "Companies are embracing learning as a core skill, as technological change demands stronger and more continuous connections between education and employment."

As a trained economist with work experience in the financial services sector, I have set myself a goal to create more commitment to lifelong learning in my fields by writing about key concepts on my journey and sharing it on an open platform. The focus for this blog will be on topics I have encountered in my work and studies, with a look towards practical coding solutions in popular languages such as Python, R and SQL.

So, with that out of the way, let's get started and **"Hello world"**!
